            <p>Our drinks are categorized as alcoholic or non-alcoholic.
                Major alcoholic categories include fermented beverages 
                like beer and wine, and distilled spirits such as whiskey and vodka. <br>
                Non-alcoholic categories are diverse, encompassing water, juices, sodas, 
                teas, coffees, and dairy-based drinks. 
                We classified our beverages:
                Fruit beverages. Fruit beverages are one of the popular categories of beverages 
                that are easily digestible, highly refreshing, thirst quenching, appetizing and nutritionally superior.
                *Vegetable beverages. 
                *Milk based beverages. 
                *Carbonated beverages. 
                *Malted beverages. 
                *Tea and Coffee.

            <p>With everything from green salads to pasta salads and more,
                We have broken down our range of Salads into four main categories–tossed,
                composed, bound, and those without lettuce (this is our own personal addition,
                because we believe pasta and grain salads are very much worthy of being in the salad family)

            <p>Burgers, hot dogs, chicken drumsticks, and veggie skewers are all inexpensive 
                crowd-pleasers that can feed 30 guests without much hassle. Bulk buying meat or
                plant-based alternatives helps reduce costs, and sides like coleslaw, potato salad, 
                and corn on the cob are both cheap and filling.
